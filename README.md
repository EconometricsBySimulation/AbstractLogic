## AbstractLogic.jl
An Abstract Reasoning Logic Interface for evaluating logical assertions built entirely in Julia.

# 
The primary purpose of such an interface for me would be to generate logical reasoning test questions and more generally to define the domain of test questions such that they can be easily classified.

Currently the code looks something like see example folder for the Harry Potter potion solver example.
