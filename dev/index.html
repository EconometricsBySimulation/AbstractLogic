This solver specifically is built to handle verbal abstract logic problems which have a finite number of possible permutations. Verbal abstract reasoning problems are often found in cognitive testing environments such as employee aptitude testing and prominently as a section on the Law School Entrance Exam.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Why-an-abstract-logic-solver?-1" href="#Why-an-abstract-logic-solver?-1">Why an abstract logic solver?</a></h3><p>The cost of hand writing and evaluating items can be expensive. Abstract logic items are easy to write but relatively hard to evaluate. This package goes a long way to reducing the cost of evaluating items and is intended as a tool to aid in the generation of large batches of abstract reasoning items.</p><p>The need for large batches of items stems from a great deal of interest by test takers in illegally obtaining copies of items from high stakes exams. Cheating on high stakes exams is known to be common. This forces testing companies to spend a great deal of resources protecting their intellectual capital while also creating an environment in which they finds themselves vulnerable to accusations of secrecy. Producing tools that reduce the cost of generating and evaluating items has the promise of alleviating concerns over item exposure.</p><p>In addition to the benefit to testing companies of reduced cost items, reducing the cost of items has the promise of aiding in the production of items for the use by researchers and companies interested in evaluating the efforts and aptitudes of their employees who do not have the means of producing their own instrument or of obtaining and providing a secure environment for the deployment of a commercial instrument.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="A-Simple-Example-1" href="#A-Simple-Example-1">A Simple Example</a></h3><p>A typical kind of problem which one might have encountered in an aptitude test at some point in ones life might look like the following.</p><pre><code class="language-none">Peter is younger than Susan.

Whatever you do on Fri must be different from what you do on Sat or Sun.
You must do homework at least one night on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday
You eat out at least twice per week.

a) Friday you do not do homework
b) Wednesday you do not call home
c) Saturday you do not workout
d) Tuesday you do not workout
