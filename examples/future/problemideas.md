### Building Space
A new seven story building has five companies who wish to rent space. Only one company can rent a given floor. 
A company may rent more than one floor, but the floors must be adjacent.  
Companies are labelled A, B, C, D, and E and floors are labeled from 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
All floors must be rented. Not all companies need to have a space.

Each company has a number of location requirements:
No company will rent more than 3 floors. (example clues)
If A or B rents floor 1 then D or E will rent floor 7.
A must be at least two floors away from B.
C must be at a lower level than A.
D must be at least two floors away from C.
E must rent at least two floors.
D and E have exactly two floors between their offices.
D must rent at least as many floors as C.
B does not rent floors 2, 3, or 4.
C has office space adjacent to B.

Problems:
1. If C rents floor 4 what must be true?
2. Which of the following configurations of rental space is viable?
3. If a new company F becomes available to rent space but floors two and three are empty due to construction which of the following configurations is feasible?
4. If company A decided not to rent, what must be true of a feasible plan.

### Performance
A company is planning its performance schedule over a 12 week period. 
It has four venues: New York, DC, Pittsburg, and Atlanta to choose from.
Each week they must perform in exactly one venue. 

The schedule rules are as follows:
No performance can occur in the same venue two weeks in row.
The company must perform in each venue at least twice.
The company must perform in New York twice in the first four weeks and no more than once in the last four weeks.
If the company performs in DC it must perform in Pittsburg two weeks later.
In between the two trips to Atlanta, the company must perform at least one trip in Pittsburg.
The company cannot perform in Atlanta until it performs in DC.

Problems:
1. If the company performs during week 1 in New York what city can it not perform in in week 7?
2. Between trips to Pittsburg, what is the longest number of weeks.
3. If the company changes its rules and is permitted to perform in one city three weeks in a row, what city is that?
